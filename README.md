# Stockformer Data File Explanation and Execution Methods

## "Stockformer" Code Overview
This paper, titled "Research on a Stock Selection Model Based on Wavelet Transform and Multi-Task Self-Attention Network of Price and Volume Factors," is currently participating in the 2024 (10th) National College Studentsâ€™ Statistical Modeling Contest.

## Original Dataset and Sub-Datasets After Partition
Due to the large size of both the original data (which contains 360 price and volume factors) and the processed data (which also contains 360 factors), the author has stored them on a cloud drive for readers to use. The folder `Stock_CN_2018-03-01_2024-03-01` contains the original data, while other folders hold the processed sub-datasets.

There are a total of 14 sub-datasets after processing, providing data support for backtesting over different time periods. The detailed contents of these datasets are as follows:
